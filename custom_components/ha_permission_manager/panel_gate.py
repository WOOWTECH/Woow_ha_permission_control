"""The Panel Gate: the one place a panel map leaves Home Assistant.

`websocket_get_panels` in `homeassistant/components/frontend/__init__.py` is
the only place a panel map reaches a browser — nothing embedded in HTML, no
REST endpoint. This module takes that handler over, lets Home Assistant compute
its own answer, and deletes from the result the panels the asking user may not
see. A denied panel is then **absent**, not hidden: no route survives for a
bookmark or a `navigate()` to reach.

Three things make the takeover work, all verified against Home Assistant
2026.7.2 and recorded in ADR-0011:

- `async_register_command` does `handlers[command] = (handler, schema)`, and
  `ActiveConnection.__init__` takes `self.handlers = hass.data["websocket_api"]`
  as a **reference, not a copy**. So installing affects connections that
  already exist, and handing back takes effect without a restart.
- `send_message` is in `ActiveConnection.__slots__` and Home Assistant
  reassigns it itself in `async_handle_close()`, so swapping it for the
  duration of one call is a supported thing to do to a connection.
- `connection.user.is_admin` is readable before the answer is, so an
  administrator's response is passed through whatever the answer turns out to
  look like. That is the escape hatch that keeps the Permission Manager panel
  reachable when everything else here has failed.

Nothing in this module copies Home Assistant's own filtering, so a change to
`to_response()` or to `config_override` cannot silently make us wrong. And
nothing here decides *which* panels a user may see: that is
`panel_policy.visible_panel_ids()`, the same function `get_panel_permissions`
reports from, so the decision and the report cannot drift (#17).

When we are installed and cannot answer, we close: a non-administrator gets the
degraded set — the router fallback and their own account page — rather than
Home Assistant's unfiltered list. When we are not installed at all there is no
choice to make, Home Assistant serves its own list, and **disabling this
integration lifts every restriction**. That is deliberate, and it is why
failing to install is an error and a notification rather than a debug line.
