"""Every write to the Permission store, and the announcement each one owes.

This module deliberately imports nothing from Home Assistant, for the reason
panel_policy.py gives: the decisions live in one place and can be unit tested
offline. Here the decision is *what a write does to the map, and what it says
it did*. Reaching the map off `hass`, persisting it and putting the
announcement on the event bus stay in `__init__.py`.

Every function takes the Permission store — the `{user_id: {resource_id:
level}}` map — mutates it in place, and returns the announcement that write
owes. There is no way to write the store without being handed something to
announce, which is the whole of issue #14: two of the five writes used to
return nothing, and the two were the revocations.

**The announcement is diagnostic, not a contract.** It says "the Permission
store has been written to, re-read it", and nothing more. Since v3.0.0 nothing
this integration ships even listens: the Filters that re-fetched on it are gone
and a live page hears about a Permission change over `panels_updated`, which
carries no payload to branch on. `action` is there so a reader of a trace can
tell the write paths apart, and the rest is detail for the same reader. ADR-0010 records that, and why a consumer must not start branching on
it.
